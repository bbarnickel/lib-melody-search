# lib-melody-search
Library providing melody search services

## Idea

Allow melody search similar to https://www.musipedia.org on several sources (mainly MIDI).
Input might be parsons code, MIDI or some simplified code describing intervals and note lengths.

Might be reasonable to normalize and convert the searchable set of melodies to a data structure or representation according to the main algorithm?

**TBC**...
